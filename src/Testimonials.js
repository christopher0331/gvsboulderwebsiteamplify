      "They go by the book, which is great because you don't want someone reporting your fence to the local municipality and have to pay a fine. They give excellent customer service, great cleaning up, on top of doing an excellent job. I highly recommend them. I don't know their travelling limit but if you're in the metro area, these are your landscaping people. Others wanted to skimp by, not show up for an estimate, not give an estimate, and some wanted to charge too much. I would hire them back, no hesitation.",
